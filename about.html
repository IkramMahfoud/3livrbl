                in the final Long-Gang <br> Chicken battle. His record on Iron Chef is 70-15-1. 
                His television trademark is a red <br> French chef's costume; he rises into 
                Kitchen Stadium holding a nashi pear in his hand. <br> He is often described 
                as the "Delacroix of French cuisine" because of the presentation <br> of his 
                dishes. His formidable record in fish challenges led to fans of the show
